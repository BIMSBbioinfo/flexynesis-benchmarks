# flexynesis-benchmarks
Comprehensive continuous benchmarking of tools for multi-omics data integration

# Goal
This repo contains a Snakemake workflow which evaluates the performance of various tools available in ["flexynesis" package](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/flexynesis)
and builds a dashboard that is used to view and compare the performance of different multi-omic integration approaches for various tasks.
